                  <p>The use of an inactivated DNA polymerase, which does not have enzymatic activity under the conditions of preparation of the PCR mixture, leads to an increase in the specificity and sensitivity of the reaction.

In this case, UDG in the new PCR run effectively hydrolyses uracil from single- and double-stranded DNA molecules during the reaction setup, thus preventing carry-over contamination by amplicon of preceding PCR and obtaining false positive results.
